 * The minimum motor current (high enough resistance) which is needed to signal that the motor has indeed stalled
 * at the upmost position. If motor has stalled with a current below this value, it would suggest that during low speed 
 * (usually RPM < 5) movement there was sudden increase in friction which caused the motor to stall. The lower voltages
 * used for low speeds most likely make the motor more susceptible to stall. 
 * 
 * Usually the RPM adjustment function would increase the PWM duty cycle but sometimes it doesn't respond quickly enough 
 * before Hall sensor timeout kicks in.
 * 
 * If this happens, you can try using a higher speeds or try to make sure there isn't any extra friction in the system
 * (such as those protruding metal tabs in the motor housing when it was disassembled and reassembled). In any case,
 * it seems that 3-4 RPM is the minimum speed which the Fyrtur can sustaing without stalling but your mileage may wary.

 * in the preset list and will signal the user by doing a little "down/up dance" curtain movement.
